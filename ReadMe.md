##Project Beginning

This project began during a job shadow in January of 2020. I was job shadowing a software engineer (Ben Stephens) at Twilio Inc for
a normal work week to learn and see what the daily life of an engineer is like. He showed me how to use Postman for testing, gave
me links for readings on flask and understanding the usefulness of API's in general. Prior to this, I had no experience working with
web systems or API's. 


##Tools Used

I installed Flask and Venv (virtual machine) for the execution and testing of this project

##Skills Learned

I take pride in saying that this project was completely self driven. Every day during the week, Ben and I would use a white board for basic Q&A
but all of the code and further research was done completely independent. This being my first coding project outside of school, it provided
a chance to learn with less structure and make it truly into something I could call my own. I learned the importance of planning out my steps,
using Test Driven Design, and how to brainstorm for a solution when there is no established path before me.



##Future Direction
In the future, I plan on expanding this product by connecting it to a live database of current NBA players. It also could serve as
a model for other leagues and could even be generalized to work with employee-company-parent company models.
